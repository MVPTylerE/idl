re: ICUR version 3.0 updates

See the end of the file for instructions on copying files.

***************************************************************************
June 1997
   Upgraded to IDL 4.0.1. Removed all references to SET_VIEWPORT.

**********************************************************************
6/16/92
  1. Fixed another bug with changing "frozen" parameters in the fitting
     routine. This affected only frozen line widths in spectra with
     non-linear wavelength scales.
  2. Changed the operating philosophy. ICURSTARTUP.PRO now initializes the
     common blocks and starts GOICUR. GOICUR has been modified to a procedure.
     Read the documentation (updated 6/16/92). This change should be transparent
     to most users. The only difference is to replace the .RUN GOICUR command
     with GOICUR.
**********************************************************************
6/13/92
  1. Fixed some nagging bugs in the fitting program. The errors are now more
     realistic, and frozed parameters stay where they should.
  2. When using data with real errors (epsilon code 30), the equivalent
     width code now gives errors on the equivelent widths. COADD also adds
     error bars now.
  3. For GHRS users: option d does quick and dirty deconvolutions of
     GHRS spectra. You will need access to the GHRS software, and will need
     to put the PSF*.DAT files in ICURDATA.
  -  Thanks to R. Tarrall and J. Neff for uncovering more bugs hidden in dimly
     lit corners of the code.
**********************************************************************
5/27/92
  1. Finalized version 3.0
  2. Revised documentation file ICUR.TEX
  3. The .ICD files are now universally readable. Use ICD_VtoU to translate
     files FTP'ed from VMS machines.
  4. Cleared up some inconsistent variable names, and removed system variable
     !debug.
**********************************************************************
5/24/92
  1. Altered the way PLDATA knows how to plot bad data. If H(33)=30
     (EPS vector is S/N vector), then the S/N vector is the bad data
     vector, and can be plotted in PLDAT. Changed BDATA, PLDATA, and all
     routines that call them. Note that this only affects PLDATA,3,... calls.
**********************************************************************
5/22/92
  1. revised KDAT, GDAT, LDAT to check system architecture when .ICD
     files are created. I can now read, under VMS, .ICD files written on a
     Sparcstation. Further tests are needed to check the other direction.
  2. Incorporated the real S/N vectors into the fitting
     routines. Defined MODE=4 in ICFIT2. 
  3. altered LINEARWAVE to overwrite header word 199.
**********************************************************************
3/11/92
   Added a spawn,'rm NL0:' at the end of ICUR for UNIX calls
**********************************************************************
3/6/92
  1. QPLT: added switch for hard copies, /hc for print, hc=-1 to make .ps file
  2. added /NOTITLE keyword to DAT_TO_ICD. Set it and you won't be asked
     for titles.
  3. common variable PSDEL, controlling the .PS output, has been revised. 
             - bit 0: set to save plot, 0 to delete
             - bit 1: set to hold plot, 0 to plot
               setting bit 1 overrides bit 0, i.e, psdel=2,3 are equivalent.
**********************************************************************
3/5/92
  1. KDAT, GDAT, and LDAT replace KEEPDAT, GETDAT, LKDAT. Default extension
     on all data files is .ICD. IDAT no longer exists as a data type
     identifier. Standard files cannot be automatically identified, and
     are prompted for at the first g command.
     Use DAT_TO_ICD to translate data files. (GETDAT -> KDAT).
  2. added w command to ICUR. This provides continuous readouts of cursor
     position when it is inside the window. Procedure CWHERE.
  3. Added USERDATA directory, at JEN's suggestion. Search path is:
       - (1) Current directory, (2) USERDATA, (3) ICURDATA
     USERDATA is read using GETENV, like ICURDATA
  4. Removed KEEPADT and MKGENFIL from the library.
**********************************************************************
2/28/92
  1. Fixed annoying bugs in FFCFIT: There was an itermittent 1/2 pixel error
     in the line position. Also, the line width is now forced to be positive.
  2. Revised logging option. Use the & command to turn it on and off within
     ICUR. The log question in the main procedure has been dropped.
  3. Simplified input to the main procedure. Just enter the file name.
     No more -2 then the file name.
  4. ICFIT: It now complains when you type an invalid option.
  5. ICUR, FUN1: Now echo command to the X screen, and tell when its waiting
     for more input. 
     Added procedure OPSTAT.
**********************************************************************
2/18/92
   Defined a new data format to ensure compatability between systems. the
   .ICD data files will replace the .DAT data files. 
   Added KDAT, GDAT, and LDAT to library. Added ancillary procedure LINEARWAVE.
**********************************************************************
2/7/92
   Corrected factor of 2 error in Gausian Integrated Flux in FFLPFW.
**********************************************************************
1/31/92
   Added new command - to permit freezing the Y scaling.
**********************************************************************
1/29/92
   1. GOICUR has been modified to clean up the code.
   2. An option to fix Y axis scaling has been added. Type _ (underscore)
      to freeze Y scaling. The _ command toggles a flag. The flag is negated
      by the Y or N commands.
   3. The plotting options in ICFIT (option F) have been upgraded.
**************************************************************************
10/7/91 update
   1. GOICUR.PRO, the main program, has been modified to permit use with
      monochrome X-windows.
   2. BBODY (option t) has been updated to permit use when the plot device
      is set to the hard copy device (!). This lets the user overplot
      black body curves on hard copies of spectra.
**************************************************************************
8/28/91 update
   1. A bug in GHRSTOICUR was fixed. Spectra can again be cross correlated to
      determine wavelength shifts.
   2. GHRSTOICUR was modified to permit storage of summed direct downlink
      data. Set the /dd keyword.
   3. TABINV was updated using the GSFC version.
*************************************************************************
7/28/91
In response to complaints, the following improvements have now been incorporated
into ICUR.

    1. The file UV.LIN should have been included for distribution. It is now.
       The files HIGH.LIN and LOW.LIN are not used, and should be discarded.
    2. All EXTRAC calls have been removed, as have some referrals to !sc3 and
       !sc4 system variables. Further vestiges of version 1 will be removed as
       necessary, and upon request.
    3. A major problem with use of ICUR on TEK teminals has been corrected.
       Basically, I forgot to put in a CASE statement for this plot device.

An improved cross correlation routine (a la Tonry and Davis), incorporating
estimates of rotational as well as radial velocities, will be added shortly.
Stay tuned.

How to copy ICUR to your home institution

All files are in 44156::rulupi$dka200:[users.public.icur]. You can access them
through the GUEST account. You can use VMS copy, i.e,

   dir 44156"guest guest"::rulupi$dka200:[users.public.icur]*.*  (to see what's there)
   copy 44156"guest guest"::rulupi$dka200:[users.public.icur]xxx.xxx *
 
or FTP, i.e,

   ftp sbast1.ess.sunysb.edu
   cd rulupi$dka200:[users.public.icur]
   ls         (if you want to know what's there)
   get ...

Note that the guest account is restricted - you cannot log into it to do
anything. You can do remote copies and directories, however. 

The files you need are:
   ICUR.COM :   a sample command file for running ICUR.
   ICUR.TLB :   the text library containing all the procedures (1273 blocks).
   ICUR.TEX :   the LATEX documentation file (39+ pages).
   ICURSTARTUP_V2.PRO: a main procedure which runs GOICUR.
   ICUR.MSG :   a file typed by GOICUR, containing messages.
   *.LIN    :   2 files (UV and OPT) containing incomplete line lists.
   *.DAT    :   5 files containing interstellar extinction curves. These are
                needed for the u command. The files are:
                NANDY.DAT, ORI.DAT, SAVMAT.DAT, SEATON.DAT, and SMC.DAT.
                12 PSF*.DAT files, useful only for persons having GHRS
                spectra and access to the GHRS software, for doing 
                quick-and-dirty deconvolutions. 
   SAMPLE.ICD: sample data file.
   EXPORT.TXT: the list of current updates to the package (which you are now
               reading).

optional files are:
   FFIT2.FOR  : the FORTRAN version of the fitting routine (optional).
   FFIT2.EXE  : The executable code for the FORTRAN fitting routine (optional).
 read the documentation before you copy these files

Please report any problems to me at 44156::FWALTER or 
FWALTER@SBAST1.ESS.SUNYSB.EDU. Also, please let me know if you actually use
the package, so that I can inform you about bug fixes.
