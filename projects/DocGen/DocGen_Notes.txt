Note that function and argument documentation is inserted into latex as-is, which means the following:

	function/arg documentation can contain any valid latex code, formula's, typesettings (bold face, etc).

	some characters will generate errors in latex, such as underscores which aren't escaped with a preceding 
	backslash, so be careful
